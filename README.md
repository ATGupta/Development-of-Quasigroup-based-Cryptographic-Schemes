# Edon80

<p>The project entitled <b>"DEVELOPMENT OF QUASIGROUP BASED CRYPTOGRAPHIC SCHEMES"</b> mainly deals with different cryptographic schemes based on non-associative and non-commutative algebraic structures viz. quasigroups. Today one of the most important National issue is secure communication and information/data storage in both military, intelligence agencies and civilian. Therefore always there is a demand to develop new encryption schemes to achieve these goals by meeting the challenges of upcoming threats. In late 1980, mainly European crypto-community has been visualized the great potentiality of using non-associative and non-commutative algebraic structures in cryptology. It gives a new direction in cryptology. In this direction Quasigroups are very suitable algebraic structures to be used.
<p>In this project we have implemented different quasigroup based transformations and different cryptographic schemes based on these transformations. Different experiments are carried out and some important properties have been observed. Here experiments mainly are carried out on quasigroups of order 4. Also write a program for arranging all quasigroups of order 4 in Lexicographical order. Finally we have coded the stream cipher Edon-80 and its modified version. Edon-80 is one of the selected stream cipher out of 15 selected ciphers for final round in e-stream competition. It has been implemented and verified successfully. In this project all cryptographic schemes are coded in MatLab.
<p>All schemes are verified and tested by using the examples of encryption / decryption. Edon-80 has been applied on different type of inputs and also gives the output in different forms. It has been also applied successfully on image inputs. Some samples of Edon-80 key stream have been generated of length 10 6 bits and NIST tests have been carried out successfully.
<p>The project plays a very important role in analyzing the pattern of output strings and choice of quasigroups and leader. It will also help to understand the insight of design principles of Edon-80. It will help to design new schemes / customized Edon-80 in future.
